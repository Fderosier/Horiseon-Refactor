Usage
Integrating accessibility attributes into the Horiseon webpage aims to make it comprehensible for individuals with visual impairments and other disabilities, ensuring not only the textual content but also the imagery is accessible. Without descriptive text, screen readers would only convey image file names without detailing the image content.

Moreover, the previous version had issues with HTML semantics. The updated iteration features a streamlined workflow and commented code, facilitating future modifications with ease. These changes maintain the user-facing appearance while significantly improving code readability for developers.
